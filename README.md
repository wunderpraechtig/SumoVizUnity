## New in this Version (JPS)

1. Import geometry file in `JuPedSim` format
2. Import trajectory file in `JuPedSim` format
3. Added file explorer in order to choose new files
4.  3D geometries (different floors, stairs, etc)
5.  Redesign of Textures and Materials
6.  3D trajectoriy Lines can now be displayed

## Todo
- Change trajectory line color based on walking speed
- Create a standalone version (create new File-explorer, current version only works through Utility Library in Unity)
- Fix "Fundamental Diagram" (Materials are outdated)
- Display pedestrian information as text next to each pedestrian (e.g. ID, height, etc)
- Export the results of the fundamental diagram
