## New in this Version (JPS)

1. Import geometry file in `JuPedSim` format
2. Import trajectory file in `JuPedSim` format
3. Added file explorer in order to choose new files
4.  3D geometries (different floors, stairs, etc)
5.  Redesign of Textures and Materials
6.  3D trajectoriy Lines can now be displayed

## Todo
